# Workshop 4

By: Jamie Mitchell

## Emphasis

In only 60 years, the field of _computing and information systems_ has redefined the traditional ways of business, education, government, and entertainment. Virtually every organization and every field of study rely on computers and related technologies to succeed in the _Information Age_. Even our everyday vocabulary embraces words like The Internet, email, Google, Facebook, YouTube, MP3, ATM, and Wii.

## Strong

The study of **computing and information systems** is central to our understanding of how the world processes, manages and communicates information using digital technologies. As a student, you learn to build and use **computing and information systems**. You learn to see things from a broader systems perspective and to develop integrated solutions that meet the needs of your users. And you learn to appreciate the far-reaching cultural, ethical, and legal impact of digital systems.
